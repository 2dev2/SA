Dropbox is a cloud storage service that allows users to store their data on remote servers. The remote servers store files durably and securely, and these files are accessible anywhere with an Internet connection. Usually, these servers are maintained by cloud storage providers and made available to users over a network (typically through the Internet). Users pay for their cloud data storage.
