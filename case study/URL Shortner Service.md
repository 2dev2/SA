### 1. Understand the System

A URL shortener is used to create a short alternative URL to a perhaps a long URL for a resource. Both the short and the long URL point to the same resource. 

Below is an example of a long URL and its short URL created using a bitly and tinyurl service:
Long URL: https://www.codercrunch.com/post/1763802291/build-a-stock-market-app-in-android

Bitly:  https://bit.ly/38h5WMU

TinyURL: https://tinyurl.com/wdk2fsw

Some of the benefits of the short URL are:
- Accuracy
A short URL is to promote accuracy. It is easier to simply copy, share in tweets, messages, etc. The short URL most like will not get truncated or somehow not get misinterpreted due to special characters or encoding differences when pasted or shared across apps or devices.

- Optimized for Space 
A short URL occupies less space compared to a long URL. In some cases, the short URL is 80%+ shorter than the long URL. Service like the Twitter limit tweet to 140 chars, so having a short URL instead of a long URL in a tweet message is needed to save on the allowed character limit per message.

- Branding
Instead of using domain names associated with the shortening service with you can create a short URL associated with your domain names. This further ensures that the destination page is associated with the domain (brand) and the user will not be taken to any random or unknown location when they click the short URL.  e.g. the branded short URL for this page.

- Optimized for Apps
It is easy to encode a short URL into a QR code rather than using a long URL. Likewise, it is easier for applications to read and process short URLs rather than a complex long URL.

- Aesthetically Pleasing
Short URLs are easy on the eyes as they hide all the path and dynamic query parameters in the URL that are required by the landing page to function.
