Virtual Machine (IAAS)
 provision individual VMs along with the associated networking and storage components. 
 Then you deploy whatever software and applications you want onto those VMs. 
 This model is the closest to a traditional on-premises environment, except that Microsoft/AWS manages the infrastructure. You still manage the individual VMs.
* Azure VM
* EC2
* Google Compute Engine
