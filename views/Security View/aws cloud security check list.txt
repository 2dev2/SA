IAM
Avoid using AWS root account user access keys as it gives full access to all resources
MFA authentication is enabled for the root account to provide two-factor authentication
Assign individual IAM users with necessary permissions to enable login
Ensure User Accounts also have MFA authentication
IAM Access Keys must be rotated at periodic intervals
Ensure a strong password policy for users
Assign permissions to users based on User Groups, instead of individual IAM users
Provide access to a resource through IAM Roles
Grant least access while creating IAM Policies, needed to perform the necessary actions
Attach IAM Policies to Groups or Roles on creation
If required, conditions can be defined for Policies under which access is granted to a resource
Get rid of unnecessary IAM credentials, those with are inactive or unused
Use IAM Roles to grant access to applications on EC2 Instances

S3
Ensure S3 buckets are not publicly accessible (public read or write permissions) — users can enable ‘Amazon S3 block public access’
Make use of object-level or bucket-level permissions in addition to IAM Policies to grant access to resources
Enable MFA Delete to prevent accidental deletion of buckets
Consider encryption of stored data, which can be done in two ways — server-side and client-side encryption
Enable encryption of inbound and outbound data traffic, through SSL endpoints
Configure S3 lifecycle management through rule-based actions and use versioning to store and retrieve multiple versions of an object in a bucket, to deal with accidental deletions
Ensure S3 access logging is enabled
Constantly audit and monitor S3 buckets using CloudWatch metrics
EC2, VPC & EBS
Ensure data and disk volumes in EBS are encrypted with AES-256, the industry standard algorithm
Restrict access to instances from limited IP ranges using Security Groups
Limit the range of open ports on EC2 security groups, to prevent exposure to vulnerabilities
Ensure ELBs have a valid security group attached to it
Monitor and optimize default security groups, as they allow unrestricted access for inbound and outbound traffic
Ensure restricted inbound access to SSH, FTP, SMTP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MSSQL, CIFS, etc; to required entities only
Use IAM roles to grant access to EC2, instead of access keys for temporary requirements
If you’re using IAM user access keys for long term permissions, ensure that you don’t embed the keys directly into code, generate different keys for different applications, rotate your access keys, use MFA authentication and decommission unused key pairs.
Enable and activate your VPC flow logs to record inbound and outbound traffic in your VPC for better monitoring and early diagnosis
Delete unused Virtual Private Gateways and VPC Internet Gateways
Make sure that no VPC endpoints are exposed, by checking the principal value in the policy
Ensure no ACLs allow unrestricted inbound or outbound access

CloudTrail
Ensure CloudTrail is activated across all regions, and for global services like IAM, STS, etc
It is recommended to log to a centralized S3 bucket
Make sure both CloudTrail itself and CloudTrail logging are enabled for all regions
Ensure CloudTrail log file integrity validation is enabled
Ensure CloudTrail log files are encrypted

RDS
Ensure RDS security groups do not allow unrestricted access
Ensure encryption of the RDS instances and snapshots, using AES-256 level encryption
Protect data in transit to RDS through SSL endpoints
Monitor control to RDS using AWS KMS and Customer Managed Keys
Ensure RDS database instances and snapshots are not publicly accessible
Enable the auto minor upgrade feature for RDS

Redshift
Enable require_ssl parameter in all Redshift clusters to minimize risk for encryption of data in transit for Redshift, and to connect your SQL client with your cluster
Enable Redshift Cluster encryption
Ensure Redshift user activity logging is enabled
Ensure Redshift encryption with KMS Customer Managed Keys
It is recommended that Redshift clusters are launched within a VPC for better control
Ensure that the Redshift clusters are not publicly accessible
