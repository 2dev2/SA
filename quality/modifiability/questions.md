* Will the software be communicating with other third-party software and legacy systems?

* Are there competing technology environments?

* Are you aware of rising technology trends in OS, hardware, and languages?

* Is the requirement modular enough to create a modular architectural design?

* Is the code that is being written easy to debug?

* Do developers understand the commenting and documentation standards that must be followed?

* Is there enough documentation and relevant comments in the code, so that it is easy for a new developer to understand?

* Is there a low level of code coupling?

* Do you know how much time you will take to create new interfaces?

* Does your development team understand the coding standards that they have to follow?

* Do you have software quality testing in place?

* Do you have a continuous delivery model?

* Is this system the start of a new product line?

* Will other systems be built that more or less match the characteristics of the system under construction? If so, what components will be reused in those systems?

* What Changes could impact components, services, features, and interfaces when adding or changing the functionality, fixing errors, and meeting new business requirements ?

* Does business rule values change frequently ?

* Does Business process change frequently ?

* What existing components are available for reuse?

* Are there existing frameworks or other code assets that can be reused?

* Will other applications reuse the technical infrastructure that is created for this application?

* What are the associated costs, risks, and benefits of building reusable components?

* Excessive dependencies between components and layers

* The use of direct communication prevents changes to the physical deployment of components and layers. 

* Reliance on custom implementations of features such as authentication and authorization prevents reuse. 

* The logic code of components and segments is not cohesive.

* The code base is large, unmanageable, fragile, or over complex.

* The existing code does not have an automated regression test suite.

* Lack of documentation may hinder usage, management, and future upgrades.
