What existing components are available for reuse?

Are there existing frameworks or other code assets that can be reused?

Will other applications reuse the technical infrastructure that is created for this application?

What are the associated costs, risks, and benefits of building reusable components?

Excessive dependencies between components and layers

The use of direct communication prevents changes to the physical deployment of components and layers. 

Reliance on custom implementations of features such as authentication and authorization prevents reuse. 

The logic code of components and segments is not cohesive.

The code base is large, unmanageable, fragile, or over complex.

The existing code does not have an automated regression test suite.

Lack of documentation may hinder usage, management, and future upgrades.
