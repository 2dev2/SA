1. Adaptive Maintenance — The system needs to adapt to the changing technological environment or landscape (hardware, operating system or the platform). This aspect puts a demand on the design of the software itself. If you are dealing with COTS, then adaptive maintenance is something you need to perform regularly.
2. Corrective maintenance- If some bugs or issues occur within the software or if there is any failure, necessary corrective actions should be easy to initiate. Similarly, any correction/code change should not lead to the failure of any other part of the software. Here design patterns, loose coupling, and quality of code are the main concern.
3. Perfective Maintenance- It deals with making functional enhancements to the system in addition to the existing features as per user requirements or with an intention of continuous improvement. This is not based on the discovery of any faults but with the concept of continual improvement. Perfective maintenance is dependent on your contract and has an investment/expense implication.
4. Preventive Maintenance — It deals with the activities that are undertaken to prevent the occurrence of errors or faults.
