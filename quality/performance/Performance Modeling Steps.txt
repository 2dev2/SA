The performance modeling process consists of the following steps:
1. Identify key scenarios. Identify those scenarios in which performance is
important and the ones that pose the most risk to your performance objectives.

2. Identify workloads. Identify how many users, and how many concurrent users,
your system needs to support.

3. Identify performance objectives. Define performance objectives for each of your
key scenarios. Performance objectives reflect business requirements. 

4. Identify budget. Identify your budget or constraints. This includes the maximum
execution time in which an operation must be completed and resource utilization
such as CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network I/O constraints.

5. Identify processing steps. Break your scenarios down into component
processing steps.

6. Allocate budget. Spread your budget determined in Step 4 across your
processing steps determined in Step 5 to meet the performance objectives you
defined in Step 3.

7. Evaluate. Evaluate your design against objectives and budget. You may need to
modify design or spread your response time and resource utilization budget
differently to meet your performance objectives.

8. Validate. Validate your model and estimates. This is an ongoing activity and
includes prototyping, testing, and measuring
