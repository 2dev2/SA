What is the impact of a failure?

How are hardware and software failures identified?

How quickly must the system be operational after a system failure?

Are there redundant systems that can take over in case of a failure?

How do you know that all critical functions have been replicated?

Are backups done? How long does it take to back up and restore the system?

What are the expected hours of operation?

What is the expected up-time per month?

How available is the current system? Is this acceptable

Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, which prevent authorized users from accessing the system, can interrupt operations 

Inappropriate use of resources can reduce availability.

Bugs or faults in the application can cause a system wide failure.

Frequent updates, such as security patches and user application upgrades, can reduce the availability of the system.

A physical tier such as the database server or application server can fail or become unresponsive, causing the entire system to fail. 

A network fault can cause the application to be unavailable
