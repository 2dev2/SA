* Are there tools, processes, and techniques in place to test language classes, components, and services?

* Are there hooks in the frameworks to perform unit tests?

* Can automated testing tools be used to test the system?

* Can the system run in a debugger?

* Complex applications with many processing permutations are not tested consistently, perhaps because automated or granular testing cannot be performed if the application has a monolithic design. 

* Lack of test planning.

* Poor test coverage, for both manual and automated tests. 

* Input and output inconsistencies; for the same input, the output is not the same and the output does not fully cover the output domain even when all known variations of input are provided.
