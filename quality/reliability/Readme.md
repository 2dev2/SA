The probability of executing for a period of The probability of executing for a period of time without failure (MBTF)

Reliability: Something is designed to a certain specifications. If 100 of those items are designed, and 99 work as per the specifications, then the reliability of that item is 99%.
Meaning it works to its specifications.

Robust: When the designed product above ends up being used in a ways it is not supposed to, but it still functions well, then it is robust.

Example: An umbrella is designed to withstand winds of 10 mile an hour speeds without flipping and wetting the user in the rain. If all the umbrellas work as specified at 10 mph, then you have designed a very reliable product.
Say designer A’s umbrellas all flip at 11mph
Say designer B’s umbrellas dont flip up to 30mph winds

Although both designer’s umbrellas are reliable, Designer B’s umbrellas are more robust.

Reliability is a measure of the percentage uptime, considering the downtime due only to faults. Reliability is usually measured in terms of the mean (average) time between failures.

Availability is a measure of the percentage uptime, considering the downtime due to faults and other causes such as planned maintenance. Availability is the measure of the proportion of time the IT system is likely to be operational over a given interval. It takes into account both the mean time between failures and the mean time to repair 

Reliability is a measure of how often the IT system fails to operate. As there are various ways a system can fail, there are usually different categories of failure depending on severity. The failure type of greatest concern, of course, is catastrophic failure, meaning that the system stops working altogether. 
“the probability of failure-free software operation for a specified period of time in a specified environment.”

Resiliency is a measure of the IT system's ability to self-recover from problems that might otherwise cause it to fail,
Resiliency is the ability of a cloud-based service to withstand certain types of failure and yet remain functional from the customer perspective.  In other words, reliability is the outcome and resilience is the way you achieve the outcome. 

Not only is availability a function of reliability, but it is also a function of maintainability.  Reliable applications should maintain a pre-defined percentage of uptime (availability). Just as important, applications should be able to recover from failures (resiliency).
