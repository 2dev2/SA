The probability of executing for a period of The probability of executing for a period of time without failure (MBTF)

Reliability: Something is designed to a certain specifications. If 100 of those items are designed, and 99 work as per the specifications, then the reliability of that item is 99%.
Meaning it works to its specifications.

Robust: When the designed product above ends up being used in a ways it is not supposed to, but it still functions well, then it is robust.

Example: An umbrella is designed to withstand winds of 10 mile an hour speeds without flipping and wetting the user in the rain. If all the umbrellas work as specified at 10 mph, then you have designed a very reliable product.
Say designer A’s umbrellas all flip at 11mph
Say designer B’s umbrellas dont flip up to 30mph winds

Although both designer’s umbrellas are reliable, Designer B’s umbrellas are more robust.
