In data flow architecture, the whole software system is seen as a series of transformations on consecutive pieces or set of input data, where data and operations are independent of each other. In this approach, the data enters into the system and then flows through the modules one at a time until they are assigned to some final destination

Pipe and Filter Architecture
It transforms the data of the input data stream which is first-in/first-out buffer, processes it, and writes the transformed data stream over a pipe for the next filter to process.
 
Batch Sequential
The flow of data carries a batch of data as a whole from one subsystem to another.
