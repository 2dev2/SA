In distributed architecture, components are presented on different platforms and several components can cooperate with one another over a communication network in order to achieve a specific objective or goal.

Client-Server Architecture
The client-server architecture is the most common distributed system architecture which decomposes the system into two major subsystems or logical processes −
Client − This is the first process that issues a request to the second process i.e. the server.
Server − This is the second process that receives the request, carries it out, and sends a reply to the client.

Multi-Tier Architecture 
Multi-tier architecture is a client–server architecture in which the functions such as presentation, application processing, and data management are physically separated. By separating an application into tiers, developers obtain the option of changing or adding a specific layer, instead of reworking the entire application. It provides a model by which developers can create flexible and reusable applications.

Broker Architectural Style
Broker Architectural Style is a middleware architecture used in distributed computing to coordinate and enable the communication between registered servers and clients. 

Service-Oriented Architecture
A service is a component of business functionality that is well-defined, self-contained, independent, published, and available to be used via a standard programming interface. 

Microservice Architecture
architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are. Highly maintainable and testable. Loosely coupled. Independently deployable.

A peer-to-peer (P2P) 
architecture consists of a decentralized network of peers -nodes that are both clients and servers. P2P networks distribute the workload between
peers, and all peers contribute and consume resources within the network without the need for a centralized server.
